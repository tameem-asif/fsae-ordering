# CU Formula Racing Ordering Website

This is a website that will serve as the ordering sheet for the CU Formula Racing team. Currently, it is a WIP with most of the backend unfinished. It is accessible at [this link](tameem.dev).

## Further Info

Currently, the website is being hosted using the Apache webserver. The plan is to have a backend using the MongoDB database to store all the order info. There will also be authentication using "Sign in with Google" built into the website so that users with a columbia.edu or barnard.edu email address can make an account to access the ordering sheet and the database.
